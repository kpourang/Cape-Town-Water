<p>The City of Cape Town is in crisis mode at the moment due to severe droughts experienced during the last couple of years, and they risk running out of water! This will be the first time ever that this happens to a world city. The city is busy with multiple initiatives to increase the water supply (such as desalination plants), but also requires the citizens to reduce their daily water usage. </p>

<p>The mayor of the City of Cape Town has hired you to assist with generating insights and really good looking map visualisations for their #DayZero campaign to make citizens aware of the crisis and the impact (#DayZero being the day the city runs out of water). With the worldâ€™s eyes on what is going on in Cape Town, the bar is set quite high and the visualisations need to be ready to be shown on world news media such as CNN!</p>

<p>The mayoral committee requires the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using the supplied shapefile data, create 3 different map visualisations depicting the dam capacity for the 6 major dams in the Cape Town region: Voelvlei, Wemmershoek, Berg River, Theewaterskloof, Steenbras (Upper) and Steenbras (Lower). Each of the visualisations need to visually depict the outline of the dam as well as indicate the individual capacity in comparison with the other dams.The maps specification is as follows:</li>
<ol style = "list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Depicted with the Tableau Dark map layer theme.</li>
    <li>Shown on a satellite image as background layer.</li>
    <li>With a custom Pencil theme as background layer.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<li>Using the pencil theme create in c) above, show the actual dam level as a percentage of capacity. Two visualisations are required here:</li>
<ol style = "list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>User should be able to select a specific year to see the level at the point in time.</li>
    <li>User should be able to select a specific month and year combination to see the level at the point in time.</li> 
</ol>
<p></p>
<li>Create a dashboard consisting of two maps where the user can select a combination of year, month and selection of dams to compare to levels at different points in time.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Create a map of the average overall dam level, with an option to allow user to investigate trend over the last couple of years.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Using the provided shapefile, display all dams next to each other in their actual shape, but this should not be on a map. Represent the average dam level with color as well as the percentage with a label. Add animation to see the change year by year.</li>
</ol>
